# g8

## Why g8 ?
```g8``` is meant to *worldwidely* replace ```wget``` to download a single file. Yep, just that. It doesn't do anything else, but you type 2 letters instead of 4, and it's pretty.

## Output example
![g8 output](img/demo.gif?raw=true "g8 output")

## Usage
Just type ```g8``` followed by the URL of the file you want to download. It will be downloaded in the current directory.

## Installation
```python3 setup.py install```
(You may need to install manually the dependencies, see ```requirements.txt```)
