# g8

## Why g8 ?
```g8``` is meant to *worldwidely* replace ```wget``` to download a single file. Yep, just that. It doesn't do anything else, but you type 2 letters instead of 4, and it's pretty.

According to **[LiveChat](https://www.livechat.com/)**, an **average person** types **190** to **200** characters per minute. That means that typing ```wget``` takes **1.2 to 1.26 seconds**. Typing ```g8``` takes **0.6 to 0.63 seconds**. That's **two times faster**. That's a lot of time saved.

## Output example
![g8 output](img/demo.gif?raw=true "g8 output")

## Usage
Just type ```g8``` followed by the URL of the file you want to download. It will be downloaded in the current directory.

## Installation
```python3 setup.py install```
(You may need to install manually the dependencies, see ```requirements.txt```)
